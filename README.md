TO-DO-LIST

A simple command-line To-Do List application built in Python.  
It allows you to add, view, remove, and manage tasks easily right from the terminal.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Add multiple tasks at once  
âœ… View all tasks in a neatly formatted list  
âœ… Remove tasks by their number  
âœ… Save tasks automatically (optional improvement)  
âœ… User-friendly and beginner-friendly code  
âœ… No external libraries required (just pure Python!)

ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- When you run the program, a menu appears:
1.Add Task
2.Show Tasks
3.Remove Task
4.Exit

Choose an option by typing a number (1â€“4).  
Add, view, or remove your tasks interactively.  
Exit anytime â€” your data can be saved if you add file storage support.
